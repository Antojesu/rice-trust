    <h1>HISTORY OF OUR ORGANISATION</h1>

    <p>The <strong>Rural Integrated Childcare and Education Trust (RICE TRUST)</strong>, 
    located in Melamanjampatty, is a non-governmental organization created to build a better 
    society through charitable actions. It was registered under the Indian Trust Act of 1882 in 
    Manapparai on 4th November 2008. The registration number of the Trust is 598/2008. 
    An amendment deed was registered in 2021 due to the demise of the Managing Trustee, 
    Mrs. S. Kulandai Therese.</p>

    <p><strong>St. Joseph’s Institute of Education and Arts</strong>, a social service 
    organization aimed at serving the poor and needy of society, was established at 
    Malaiadipatty in 1989 in remembrance of Rev. Fr. K.P. Joseph, who helped morally and 
    spiritually to educate downtrodden students at St. Joseph’s College, Trichy. Though 
    the founding members secured government jobs, their desire to serve never diminished. 
    One of the members, Mr. Thomas Maria Soosai Rajan (B. Sc., B. Ed., D. Comm. – France), 
    an educator and social worker, took the initiative to register the society under the 
    Indian Trusts Act, 1882. Thus, the <strong>Rural Integrated Childcare and Education Trust (RICE TRUST)</strong> was born.</p>

    <p>Over the years, we have been actively involved in various fields such as child care, 
    supervised study, sponsorship programs, human rights awareness programs, education, 
    women empowerment programs, environmental protection programs, sports and games, 
    farmer training programs, naturopathy, AIDS awareness programs, healthcare, and 
    career guidance for young people. Our trust is committed to instilling human values 
    in children and youth, ensuring they lead a happy and successful life.</p>

    <h2>EDUCATION</h2>

    <p>Education is now seen by the youth as a gateway to socio-economic advancement. 
    With the introduction of compulsory primary education, there has been a rise in 
    population awareness, leading to an increased demand for educational and technical 
    institutions. However, the quality of education in many institutions remains a concern.</p>

    <p>Many children face learning difficulties and become victims of their own inabilities. 
    The <strong>Rural Integrated Childcare and Education Trust</strong> took action by organizing 
    free study centers to aid in their holistic development.</p>

    <p>Our members have worked tirelessly to educate parents about the importance of education. 
    Thanks to our efforts, many people now recognize its value. Children from different villages 
    attend various schools, acquiring essential knowledge and life skills. However, after school, 
    many lack home guidance, leading to difficulties in their studies and, in some cases, school 
    dropouts.</p>

    <p>To address this issue, we have appointed teachers to support these children in their holistic 
    development. We aim to establish additional study centers in different villages, providing 
    support to children, parents, and the community.</p>
